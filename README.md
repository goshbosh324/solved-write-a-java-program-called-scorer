Write a complete Java program called Scorer that declares a two-dimensional array of doubles (call it scores) with three rows and three columns and that uses methods and loops as follows:

Use a method containing a nested while loop to get the nine (3 x 3) doubles from the user at the command line.

Use a method containing a nested for loop to compute the average of the doubles in each row.

Use a method to output these three row averages to the command line.
